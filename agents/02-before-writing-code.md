# AGENTS.md - Before Writing Code

## 1. Before writing code

**Goal: understand the problem and the codebase before producing a diff.**

- State your plan in one or two sentences before editing. For anything non-trivial, produce a numbered list of steps with a verification check for each.
- Read the files you will touch. Read the files that call the files you will touch. Claude Code: use subagents for exploration so the main context stays clean.
- Match existing patterns in the codebase. If the project uses pattern X, use pattern X, even if you'd do it differently in a greenfield repo.
- Surface assumptions out loud: "I'm assuming you want X, Y, Z. If that's wrong, say so." Do not bury assumptions inside the implementation.
- If two approaches exist, present both with tradeoffs. Do not pick one silently. Exception: trivial tasks (typo, rename, log line) where the diff fits in one sentence.

## 2. Writing code: simplicity first

**Goal: the minimum code that solves the stated problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code. No configurability, flexibility, or hooks that were not requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios. Handle the failures that can actually happen.
- If the solution runs 200 lines and could be 50, rewrite it before showing it.
- If you find yourself adding "for future extensibility", stop. Future extensibility is a future decision.
- Bias toward deleting code over adding code. Shipping less is almost always better.

The test: would a senior engineer reading the diff call this overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.
